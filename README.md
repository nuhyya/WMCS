As wildlife faces growing threats from habitat loss, climate change, poaching, and human expansion, thereâ€™s an urgent need for tools that enable conservationists to respond effectively. 
Data-driven platforms offer crucial insights into species trends, habitat use, and human-wildlife conflicts, helping protect endangered species and sustain ecosystems.


Our project, Wildlife Management and Conservation System is a database solution designed to streamline the collection, management, and analysis of data crucial for wildlife conservation. 
This platform consolidates information on species, habitats, health records, and human-wildlife interactions, providing conservationists and researchers with the insights needed to make timely, informed decisions.
Equipped with trackers for species movements, health monitoring tools, and automated analytics, the system enables conservation teams to respond effectively to emerging threats and trends. 
With a user-friendly interface and secure role-based access, the system supports data-driven strategies for protecting biodiversity and improving conservation efforts.
